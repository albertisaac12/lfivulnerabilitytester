# LFI Vulnerability Tester

This Python script is designed to test for Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities in web applications. LFI vulnerabilities occur when a web application allows an attacker to include files on the server, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information or remote code execution.

## Introduction

Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a web vulnerability that allows an attacker to access, view, or include files located on the server in the document root folder. LFI occurs when user-supplied input is not properly validated. Attackers typically manipulate user-controllable input, such as URL parameters or cookies, to specify the file path to include.

## Features

- Test for LFI vulnerabilities in web applications.
- Specify custom headers and cookies.
- Use a customizable wordlist for payload injection.
- Generate a detailed report of potential vulnerabilities.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/albertissac12/lfivulnerabilitytester.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd lfivulnerabilitytester
   ```

4. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the script with the following command-line arguments:

```bash
python lfi_tester.py <URL> [-H HEADERS] [-C COOKIES] [-w WORDLIST]
```

## Options

- `<URL>`: The URL of the web application to test for LFI vulnerabilities.
- `-H, --headers`: Optional. Headers in the format `'HeaderName: Value'`. Separate multiple headers with a comma and space.
- `-C, --cookies`: Optional. Cookies in the format `'CookieName=CookieValue'`. Separate multiple cookies with a semicolon and space.
- `-w, --wordlist`: Optional. Path to the wordlist containing LFI payloads. The default is `wordlist.txt`.

## Example

```bash
python lfi_tester.py http://example.com -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0" -C "sessionid=abc123" -w mywordlist.txt
```

## Output

After running the script, potential vulnerable URLs will be saved to the `output.txt` file and all responses will be logged in the console.
